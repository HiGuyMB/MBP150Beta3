MMG DC: interiors not read correctly by game, checks interiors_mbp


before i forget:

- new achievements required on LBs (we're getting a challenge mode, so we'll add a few there)
- NEW LEVELS for LBs. At least 25 new ones.

- seizure's J ? would be v. good for us. [seiz says unknown]


Massive stuff: need to get the installers fixed. whatever I got from spy47 with NSIS is broken as shit out of nowhere and I can't fix it.

A few stuff phil identified and are todo's for PQ, and I'd like to see if it's even possible (if yes, will make stuff for PQ easier):
- it's possible to drop marble at 0 0 0 using a quick console command (even if we don't have enablewinconsole, it's still scary), can't remember function
- it's possible to do game state end and thus get instant win on LBs, even without gem collection
--> either change the name of this thing to throw hackers off a little
--> or make some additional checks or anti hacks (e.g. can't be sub 250ms, or does player really have all gems)
This is some nasty stuff... might not even be worth the effort so low priority.




Note: customs in level packs 10-24 do not get awarded ratings properly
They're 20-30k less than what it should be
Therefore, on new Leaderboards, most of these do not need rating adjustment
This is because proper calculations will occur, thus increasing most of them instantly.
However, some were increased on purpose to give the proper rating as a workaround for this bug.
Therefore, quite a number of those need their ratings lowered to match with current ones.
Any levels not mentioned below in level packs 10-24 need to be subjected to this.


//----------- MBG (1 total):

Tightrope - 150-200% more rating, standeriser unlikely to be touched but if yes, tad mode it (0.5-1.5 points increase)
