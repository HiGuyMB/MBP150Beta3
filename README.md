Marble Blast Platinum 1.50 - Beta 3
---

Sources and assets to Marble Blast Platinum 1.50 Beta 3, uploaded so I can admire the Torque Script mess Jeff and I made back in 2013. The code is not super pretty and I didn't bother cleaning up any of it. There is plenty of profanity and a couple of places where we lost it. You have been warned.

These sources taken from SVN revision 2938, April 8, 2014 at 01:14:25 EDT. This is slightly after Beta 3, when we re-added all the missions and features that the Beta cut, but before RC1 or MBExtender. As a result, all features are implemented entirely in script and you'll likely see the limitations we were quickly running into at the time.

Also: Yes, we really did commit all the dso files and keep the missions in zips. No, it was not a good idea in retrospect.

## Playing
If you drop a copy of MBG in here, including the ignition files (of course you have those, right?), it should be playable. I've patched it just enough to get onto the LBs and play MultiPlayer, but the master server doesn't work so you'll have to direct connect by IP if you want to join a server.

## Leaks?
Probably nothing that wasn't revealed in the PQ open source release. Except the CRC gen which isn't used anymore anyway. There are a couple fun scripts that I've left in place because they're part of the repo history and MBP just wouldn't be complete without them.

## Anti-Cheat?
Pretty much all the anti-cheat functions have been neutralized, since the LBs don't work anymore anyway. Feel free to cheat all you want, or something. It's not like you can submit new times/scores, nor will anyone accept recs from this version.

## License?
No license, all rights reserved. Go look at [PlatinumQuest](https://github.com/PlatinumTeam/PlatinumQuest) if you want an open-source Marble Blast mod. This is only here for reference/archival purposes.
